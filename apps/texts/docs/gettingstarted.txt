===============
Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with ``texts``...


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run ``texts``:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**

These dependencies should be added to your ``requirements/project.txt`` file
and installed using pip_. For example::

    pip install -r requirements/project.txt


Installation
============

Add ``texts`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "texts",
    ]

Hook up ``texts`` to your URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # ...
        url(r"^texts/", include("texts.urls"))
    )


Seeding Database
================

Install the schema and then run ``load_tischendorf`` to get some data in the
database::

    ./manage.py load_tischendorf Jude

If you want to load the entire dataset::

    ./manage.py load_tischendorf --force

Where the ``--force`` flag will delete the previously loaded work.
